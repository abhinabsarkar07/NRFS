Backend Documentation: Train Seat Reservation System

Overview

This document outlines the backend API for the Train Seat Reservation System, including the Node.js/Express.js server, PostgreSQL database, and user authentication logic.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)

Password Hashing: bcrypt.js

Logging: Winston

Environment Variables: dotenv

Backend API Endpoints

User Authentication

POST /api/users/signup

Description: Registers a new user.

POST /api/users/login

Description: Logs in a user and returns a JWT token.

Seat Reservation

GET /api/seats

Description: Fetch all seats in the train.

GET /api/seats/available

Description: Fetch all available seats (reserved: false).

POST /api/seats/reserve

Description: Reserve seats for a user.

POST /api/seats/release/:seatId

Description: Release (unreserve) a seat.

Admin Endpoints

GET /api/admin/seats

Description: Fetch all seat reservations (Admin only).

DELETE /api/admin/seats/:seatId

Description: Remove a seat reservation (Admin only).

Middleware

Authentication Middleware

Protects routes that require user authentication using JWT.

Error Handling Middleware

Handles all errors globally during request lifecycle.

Services

User Service (userService.js) - Manages user authentication and JWT generation.

Seat Service (seatService.js) - Manages seat reservations, availability, and cancellations.

Error Handling

Example error response:

{
  "error": "Not enough seats available."
}

Deployment

Backend Deployment:

Heroku

AWS EC2

Frontend Deployment:

Vercel

Netlify

Testing

Use Postman to test API endpoints.

Ensure JWT authentication works correctly.

Validate seat reservation and release functionality.

Future Improvements

Email Verification: Add email verification upon signup.

Payment Integration: Integrate a payment gateway for seat reservations.

Seat Map: Implement a visual representation of seat availability.

Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin panel to manage seat reservations.

Conclusion

The backend system efficiently manages seat reservations, user authentication, and ensures no double-booking occurs. JWT authentication enhances security by allowing users to interact only with their own reservations.         # Entry point for the server
